# Capstone_2
Performed data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and modeling to assess and predict what factors contribute to US traffic fatalities using NHTSA FARS data. New metrics were devised to better evaluate potentially important features.			
Paired down a wide set of features through RFE to build a Decision Tree Regressor model that achieved an R2 of .88 with low RMSE and MAE scores.
